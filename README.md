### Hello, I'm [Netravati M B] 👋

I am passionate about technology and problem-solving. Here's a glimpse of my work:

## 🛠 Projects
- *Project 1*: Game networking refers to the technology and protocols used to connect players in a multiplayer video game environment. It involves managing data transfer between players' devices, servers, and game clients to ensure real-time interaction, synchronization, and communication during gameplay. Key components include server-client architecture, peer-to-peer connections, matchmaking, and latency management. The goal is to provide a smooth and responsive gaming experience while handling issues like lag, packet loss, and server load. Game networking is crucial for supporting various multiplayer game modes, from local to large-scale online interactions.
- *Project 2*: A short description of another project.
